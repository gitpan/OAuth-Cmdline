NAME
    OAuth::Cmdline - OAuth2 for command line applications using web services

SYNOPSIS
        my $oauth = OAuth::Cmdline->new( site => "spotify" );
        $oauth->access_token();

DESCRIPTION
    OAuth::Cmdline helps standalone command line scripts to deal with web
    services requiring OAuth access tokens.

WARNING: LIMITED ALPHA RELEASE
    While "OAuth::Cmdline" has been envisioned to work with various
    OAuth-controlled web services, it currently only works with Spotify. But
    stay tuned, I'll refactor the site-specific parts of the code soon, so
    that it'll work with Google Drive, Evernote and others as well. Hey, or
    send me a pull request if you want to beat me to it! :)

GETTING STARTED
    To obtain the initial set of access and refresh tokens from the
    OAuth-controlled site, you need to register your command line app with
    the site and you'll get a "Client ID" and a "Client Secret" in return.
    Also, the site's SDK will point out the "Login URI" and the "Token URI"
    to be used with the particular service. Then, run the following script
    (the example uses the Spotify web service)

        use OAuth::Cmdline;
        use OAuth::Cmdline::Mojo;

        my $oauth = OAuth::Cmdline->new(
            client_id     => "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
            client_secret => "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY",
            login_uri     => "https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize",
            token_uri     => "https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token",
            site          => "spotify",
            scope         => "user-read-private",
        );
    
        my $app = OAuth::Cmdline::Mojo->new(
            oauth => $oauth,
        );
    
        $app->start( 'daemon', '-l', $oauth->local_uri );

    and point a browser to the URL displayed at startup. Clicking on the
    link displayed will take you to the OAuth-controlled site, where you
    need to log in and allow the app access to the user data, following the
    flow provided on the site. The site will then redirect to the web server
    started by the script, which will receive an initial access token with
    an expiration date and a refresh token from the site, and store it
    locally in the cache file in your home directory (~/.sitename.yml).

ACCESS TOKEN ACCESS
    Once the cache file has been initialized, the application can use the
    "access_token()" method in order to get a valid access token. If
    "OAuth::Cmdline" finds out that the cached access token is expired,
    it'll automatically refresh it for you behind the scenes.

    "OAuth::Cmdline" also offers a convenience function for providing a hash
    with authorization headers for use with LWP::UserAgent:

        my $resp = $ua->get( $url, $oauth->authorization_headers );

    This will create an "Authorization" header based on the access token and
    include it in the request to the web service.
